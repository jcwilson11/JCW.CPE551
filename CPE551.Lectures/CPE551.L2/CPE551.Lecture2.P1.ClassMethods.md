split: 
upper: 
lower: 
isalpha: is it all letters?
isdigit: is it all numbers?
rstripL Remove whitespace (empty) characters on the right side

    if start is not specified, it defaults to 0
    if step is negative, start must be greater than stop
    if start is greater than stop, step must be negative

Class dict Methods:
Ks = list(D.keys()) will give you a list of the keys in the dictionary
xy = D.get("x", 'none') will give you the value of x if it exists, otherwise it will give you 'none'
help(D.get) will give you more info on the method

Class tuple Methods:
dir(T) will give you all the methods for a tuple
